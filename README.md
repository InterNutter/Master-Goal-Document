# Master-Goal-Document

What am I doing here? Well, I am going to learn Javascript so I can make an app so that readers can access _ALL_ of my Instant Stories from anywhere, anytime.

## What I want to do:

* Stop Using the Instants Master File (and clean a huge pile of nonsense out of my google drive)
* Gain readers via accessability

## What I want the app to do

* Read and use the Instants Master File as it stands
* Put indexed Instants on some form of cloud storage
* Allow me to input new Instants via the same app
  - which requires username and passwords/ memberships
* NO ADVERTISING! EVER!
* OPT IN FEES AND CHARGES
  - one payment once (your username is sent to me and it or a variant of it may turn up in a fresh Instant - there's a draw)
  - OR regular monthy payments with reminders (your name and info on the Thanks Page ~ plus "and You")
* Fully customisable reading experience
  - background colour
  - text colour (with checks for readability)
  - font type & size (stretch goal?)
  - option for floating footnote
    ~ fade in when in center of screen
    ~ hold to see
    ~ tap toggle
  - option for there-and-back-again footnotes
  - language translation (stretch goal)
    ~ take my chances with google translate
    ~ join the translation team (paid 10% of the gross, 5 team members max)
 
 ## Sounds like a lot
 
 I am taking my time, doing this properly, and hoping to hell I don't hit a wall somewhere
 
 Project name? _Mobile Instants_
